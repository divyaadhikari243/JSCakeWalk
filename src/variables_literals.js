/**
 * JavaScript recognises Five kind of primitives namely
 * -->Number
 * -->String
 * -->Logical
 * -->Undefined
 * -->null
 * In order to start with variable decleration lets first declare few types of variables
 * and check for validation. As we are completing these exercises the tests would be passed 
 * and you would learn JavaScript.
 * 
 * 
 * For the sake of sample we have the following :-
 * 
 * Lets describe a person and his attributes by simple examples
 * var name="Jack";
 * var age=10;
 * var isMarried=false;
 * var isHappy=true;
 * var byCycleColor=undefined;
 * 
 * Now run the SpecRuner and check whether the different tests are passed for this chapter.
 * The first sample is done for you with comments.
