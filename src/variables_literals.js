/**
 * JavaScript recognises Five kind of primitives namely
 * -->Number
 * -->String
 * -->Logical
 * -->Undefined
 * -->null
 * In order to start with variable decleration lets first declare few types of variables
 * and check for validation. As we are completing these exercises the tests would be passed 
 * and you would learn JavaScript.
 * 
 * 
 * For the sake of sample we have the following :-
 * 
 * Lets describe a person and his attributes by simple examples
 * var name="Jack";
 * var age=10;
 * var isMarried=false;
 * var isHappy=true;
 * var byCycleColor=undefined;
 * 
 * Now run the SpecRuner and check whether the different tests are passed for this chapter.
 * The first sample is done for you with comments.
 **/
 
/*
Declare a person with variable firstName as "John", lastName as "Adam", age as 40, hasCar as true and
*/

//Declaring firstName as John
var firstName = "John";

//Declaring the lastName
var lastName;
//Declaring the age of the person

//Declaring whether the person has a car or not


/**
 * Now lets look at declaring some more variables and do some type conversion on them
 * this would get you started to understand a bit more about them.
 * for example :-
 * 
 * Convert variable a from a string to a number
 * var a ="22";
 * var b = parseInt(a);
 * 
 * same goes with float too like
 * var a1 = "2.22";
 * var b1 = parseFloat(a1);
 * 
 * Converting a number to string 
 * 
 * var a2 = 22;
 * var b2 = a2.toString();
 *
